# env_explore: Quick and easy exploration of python objects

**env_explore** is a library which gives Jupyter users the ability to quickly and easily explore Python 
objects and environments. 

By combining pandas and ipywidgets, env_explore can be used to extract and process data
from almost any given python object into pandas DataFrame and generate a
clickable widget representation with which users can interact.
